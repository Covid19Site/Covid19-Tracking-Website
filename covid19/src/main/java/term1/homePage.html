    cluster of COVID-19 in Beijing, People’s Republic of China</a></h3>
  <p class="quote">Today, officials from the National Health Commission and Beijing Health
    Commission briefed
    WHO’s China country office, to share details of preliminary investigations ongoing in Beijing.
    As of 13 June, 41 symptomatic laboratory confirmed cases and 46 laboratory confirmed cases
    without symptoms of COVID-19 have been identified in Beijing.</p>
  <p>The first identified case had symptom onset on 9 June, and was confirmed on 11 June. Several of
    the initial cases were identified through six fever clinics in Beijing. Preliminary
    investigations revealed that some of the initial symptomatic cases had a link to the Xinfadi
    Market in Beijing.
    Preliminary laboratory investigations of throat swabs from humans and environmental samples from
    Xinfadi Market identified 45 positive human samples (all without symptoms at the time of
    reporting) and 40 positive environmental samples. One additional case without symptoms was
    identified as a close contact of a confirmed case.</p>
  <p>All cases are in isolation and under care as needed, and contact tracing is underway. Genetic
    sequencing of samples is also underway and rapid sharing of these results is important to
    understand the origin of the cluster and links between cases. WHO has offered support and
    technical assistance, as well as requested further information
    about the cluster and the investigations underway and planned.</p>
