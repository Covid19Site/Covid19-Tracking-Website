Many of the trial sites are part of the recently launched COVID-19 Prevention Network.Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made versions of proteins naturally produced by the immune system in response to invading viruses or other pathogens. Neutralizing antibodies, whether natural or monoclonal, can bind directly to portions of viruses that they use to attach to and enter cells, preventing them from initiating the infection cycle. Monoclonal antibodies may provide short-term protection from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus."},

If only 40% of contacts could be traced, these figures would increase to 87% and 75%, respectively.However, without these levels of testing and contact tracing, reopening of schools together with the gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a second wave that would peak in December 2020."},
