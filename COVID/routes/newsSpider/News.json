One leading health system, Northwell, has treated about 55,000 virus patients. The good news is a new study published in JAMA on August 6, 2020, found a 13.7% prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the Northwell / HCP cohort.A previous study in the Mount Sinai Health System found 36% of HCWs had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, reflecting the high exposure of inpatient and ambulatory frontline staff.'While we continue to recommend standard protective precautions for everyone, HCWs with SARS-CoV-2 IgG may become our safest frontline providers as we learn if IgG antibodies confer immunity to protect against reinfection.Knowing IgG antibody status may ease concerns regarding personal risk as this pandemic continues,' commented these researchers on June 3, 2020."},

Understanding it is key to bringing an end to the global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The problem is that the human immune system is wildly complicated, and this new betacoronavirus seems to interact with it in some unusual ways, stated an insightful article published in The Atlantic on August 5, 2020."},

Beginning August 1st, about 500,000 tests were being delivered each day across India, according to the international comparison site, Our World in Data.To meet PM Modi's goal, the BBC reported on August 8, 2020, Indian authorities have been switching over to a quicker method called a 'rapid antigen test', which can give a result in about 20 minutes. But, these tests are less reliable, with an accuracy rate in some cases as low as 50%.Dr. Anupam Singh, a public health expert in India, says 'there are some advantages to the rapid tests: \"It allows a faster detection process and means you can quickly detect highly infectious individuals with a high viral load who might be so-called super-spreaders.'But, he also has concerns about this strategy, which can potentially miss many infections."},

These researchers say 'transforming qualitative testing into a quantitative measurement of a viral load will assist clinicians in risk-stratifying patients and choosing among available therapies and trials.'Furthermore, 'viral load might also affect quarantine - isolation tactics on the basis of infectivity risk.'"}
