Germicidal UV (254 nm) readily inactivates most airborne pathogens.GUV harnesses a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that contains short waves of radiant energy, called UV-C. This wavelength is further away from the visible spectrum than other forms of UV light.And, GUV is recognized by the WHO and the US CDC as an important environmental control to reduce TB transmission, especially in high-risk settings where natural ventilation is ineffective and where mechanical ventilation is limited. Evidenced-based research from 2015 shows that upper room GUV fixtures with good air-mixing reduced TB transmission by about 80%.Recently, the Illuminating Engineering Society released guidance which suggests deploying GUV in the ceilings of big-box stores, restaurants, and grocery stores."},
